### Vue.js

Constructing complex websites with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) is surprisingly simple. 

It has a good set of tools out of the box that really speed up the development, like hot-reload, a great template system, a router and even more.

This website also uses [Buefy](https://buefy.github.io/)  its web components, like a modal box, forms, buttons, loading and overall interface.
